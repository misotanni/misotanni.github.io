# The FJS Crash Course

So, you are intrigued by what the FJS has to offer, and would like to learn to use it.

This "crash course" was designed specifically with a focus on fast acquisition of all the fundamental elements of the system. It puts less focus on its shorthand system, which is not necessary. If you already have had exposure to Just Intonation, the FJS will be extremely easy for you to learn - you can learn it all in one sitting within a few minutes. Its beauty and simplicity are at your grasp.

The course has a very simple structure. It elaborates on the seven rules of the FJS by explaining each one in turn.

## Lesson 1: Abandoning Enharmony

> **All notes with conventional accidentals represent Pythagorean tuning. All octaves are 2/1 and all perfect fifths are 3/2.**

We are all familiar with standard staff notation and its conventional sharps and flats. But what we may not realize is that we learn staff notation as adapted for our omnipresent tuning system, twelve-tone equal temperament (from now on, this course will use the abbreviation 12-EDO, for Equal Divisions of the Octave).

For example, here is the 12-EDO chromatic scale:

<img src="" alt="The chromatic scale from C, ascending: C-C♯-D-D♯-E-F-F♯-G-G♯-A-A♯-B-C">

No, wait. Actually, the way that it is most commonly written is like this:

<img src="" alt="The chromatic scale from C, ascending: C-C♯-D-D♯-E-F-F♯-G-G♯-A-B♭-B-C">

Replacing that A♯ with B♭ makes no difference to us, of course. We know that those are different names for two notes that are of the same pitch. Choosing between these names is just a matter of legibility, or consistency, or simplicity, as given by context, but they are equivalent.

This property - that the interval of a diminished second be the same size as a perfect prime - has a name: enharmonic equivalence. In fact, musicians who are not familiar with (or aware of) alternate tuning systems may not even know that this property is not universal, and that 12-EDO is one of few tuning systems that satisfies it. In other tuning systems, there is no enharmonic equivalence or there is a different interval of the same size as the perfect prime. (For example, in 19-EDO, the perfect prime is the same size as the *double* diminished second, so E♯ and F♭ are actually equivalent.)

But let's not forget that staff notation predates even the thought of using 12-EDO (to say nothing of complete dominance) by many centuries. Staff notation was originally based on the diatonic scale, which - among its many simultaneous properties - also has the property of being generated from a stack of fifths (F-C-G-D-A-E-B). Actually, the very *fact* that staff notation has multiple ways to name the same pitch in 12-EDO implies that its original construction was based on something very different from 12-EDO.

In other words, enharmonic equivalence is the only 12-EDO feature in staff notation. Everything else is independent.

The first step of the FJS is actually to **remove enharmonic equivalence** while preserving everything else. The FJS assigns the octave to the JI ratio 2/1, which already is its value in 12-EDO as well. It then assigns the perfect fifth to the JI ratio 3/2. This means that conventional staff notation is assigned to Pythagorean tuning.

Assigning the fifth to 3/2 has particular implications. Unless you are already familiar with this idea, this may seem strange to you at first: in the FJS, G♯ and A♭ are no longer the same note. In fact, no two notes of different names have the same pitch, and no two notes of different pitches have the same name. There is only one correct spelling for every note. There exists a **bijection** between Pythagorean tuning and conventional staff notation.
