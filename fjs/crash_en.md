# The FJS Crash Course

So, you are intrigued by what the FJS has to offer, and would like to learn to use it.

This "crash course" was designed specifically with a focus on fast acquisition of all the fundamental elements of the system. It puts less focus on its shorthand system, which is not necessary. If you already have had exposure to Just Intonation, the FJS will be extremely easy for you to learn - you can learn it all in one sitting within a few minutes. Its beauty and simplicity are at your grasp.

The course has a very simple structure. It elaborates on the seven rules of the FJS by explaining each one in turn.

## Lesson 1

> **All notes with conventional accidentals represent Pythagorean tuning. All octaves are 2/1 and all perfect fifths are 3/2.**

We are all familiar with standard staff notation and its conventional sharps and flats. But what we may not realize is that we learn staff notation as adapted for our omnipresent tuning system, twelve-tone equal temperament (from now on, this course will use the abbreviation 12-EDO, for Equal Divisions of the Octave).

For example, here is the 12-EDO chromatic scale:

No, wait. Actually, the way that it is most commonly written is like this:

<img src="" alt="The chromatic scale from C, ascending: C-C♯-D-D♯-E-F-F♯-G-G♯-A-B♭-B-C">

Replacing that A-sharp with B-flat makes no difference to us, of course. We know that those are different names for two notes that are of the same pitch. Choosing between these names is just a matter of legibility, or consistency, or simplicity, as given by context, but they are equivalent.
