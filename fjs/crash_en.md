# The FJS Crash Course

So, you are intrigued by what the FJS has to offer, and would like to learn to use it.

This "crash course" was designed specifically with a focus on fast acquisition of all the fundamental elements of the system. It puts less focus on its shorthand system, which is not necessary. If you already have had exposure to Just Intonation, the FJS will be extremely easy for you to learn - you can learn it all in one sitting within a few minutes. Its beauty and simplicity are at your grasp.

The course has a very simple structure. It elaborates on the seven rules of the FJS by explaining each one in turn.

## Lesson 1

> **All notes with conventional accidentals represent Pythagorean tuning. All octaves are 2/1 and all perfect fifths are 3/2.**
