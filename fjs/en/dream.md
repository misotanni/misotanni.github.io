# An FJS Dream

On the night of June 8–9, 2019, I had a peculiar dream.

By the end, I was designing a kind of interface in a square grid with cells of text (5 by 5) where I was explaining some difference between two different transpositions of the same Phrygian melody – in E, and then somewhere else in E♯. My goal was to divide the chromatic semitone between them into two unequal justly intonated quarter tones, in such a way that one of them is perceived as strong and the other one as weak (analogically to 9/8 and 10/9 dividing 5/4). In the different cells, reading from the top left across and then down, I would depict a kind of evolution of this melody.

Now, the peculiar thing is that there were intervals in this dream given to me in the FJS. They were as follows:

- P1<sub>35</sub>
- A1<sup>35</sup>
- A1<sup>5</sup><sub>7</sub>

In the dream, I was demonstrating that the obvious choice would be to transpose by the first interval, but upon closer reflection I had found out that the second interval would be a better choice. I'm not sure how the third interval was related to all this. In the dream, I could hear that the second interval was wider and felt stronger than the first.

I then woke up.

The first thing I did upon awakening was, of course, figuring out these intervals as ratios.

I didn't initially recognize P1<sub>35</sub>, but I took the intelligent guess of 36/35, and I quickly verified it was right: the difference between the 35<sup>th</sup> harmonic, M2<sup>35</sup>, and the 36<sup>th</sup>, M2. In retrospect, I could have just as easily analyzed it as the sum of P1<sub>5</sub> and P1<sub>7</sub> (81/80 and 64/63).

A1<sup>5</sup><sub>7</sub> wasn't that difficult to figure out either. I quickly verified my initial guess, 15/14, as correct.

The obstacle was A1<sup>35</sup>. This was an interval that I truly haven't seen before or could have thought about. To determine this one, I broke it up into the sum of A1<sup>5</sup> and P1<sup>7</sup>. The first one is 135/128, the strong just chromatic semitone, and the other one is 63/64. Rather than multiply 135 by 63, I factorized both and found myself multiplying 243 by 35 to get 8505, then taking the reduced form to get 8505/8192. Later, I used the FJS calculators on this site to verify my result and it was indeed correct.

This interval, together with P1<sub>35</sub>, do divide A1 into two quarter tones, of which A1<sup>35</sup> is slightly wider (64.91¢ compared to 48.77¢) and, as opposed to P1<sub>35</sub>, it is otonal, thus giving it a stronger character. So my dream used the FJS to make two predictions that both turned out to be correct.

So?

People who learn foreign languages appreciate how amazing it is to dream in a foreign language (for myself, it has happened in every language I speak confidently so far, even including Lojban). I'm not a programmer, but I did hear from programmers that there is a similar feeling connected to dreaming in code. Mathematicians will say the same for equations, and musicians will say the same for sheet music. I will additionally say the same for just intonation ratios.

I believe that real intuitive understanding of a (generalized) language is required for its incorporation into a dream. Such an understanding is gained either when one picks up the language at a very early age, where the incredible learning potential compensates for extreme complexity, or after a very long time of familiarity, when a lot of mental shortcuts have been established, or else – as in this case, when neither of the two above conditions hold – when the system in question is extremely simple.

I would be very curious to hear if someone has had an analogical dream in Ben Johnston notation. I seriously doubt it.
