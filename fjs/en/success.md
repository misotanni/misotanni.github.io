# An FJS Success Story

The FJS had, for a very long time since its creation, been a notation system that one person had known about: myself. I used it for some of my own thoughts and speculations about JI and wrote about the system, but never shared it with anyone. Therefore, while I was convinced of its simplicity in my own mind, I never had any actual empirical evidence that the FJS is truly simple.

That changed thanks to uakci, the maintainer of this website. He was the one who motivated me to create this website, and he's the one who ensures that this stuff doesn't collapse.

When I discovered another microtonal music enthusiast, my initial idea was, of course, to tell him about the FJS. I showed him links to videos where I'd used it and told him about some of its properties.

He immediately picked up the system. He intuitively understood the 5-limit lattice with increasing superscripts and subscripts of five as analogical to rows of buttons on an accordion, and the idea of multiplying these modifiers to combine them. When I sent him an FJS score, after his initial positive reaction to a key signature at the beginning, he just replied: “very comprehensible notation”.

After about two days of a casual conversation, and only one serious question (why the <sup>5</sup> accidental *lowers* a note by 81/80 instead of raising), he was already able to use the FJS.

When we were later talking about different tunings of minor and major scales, he told me he *preferred* me to notate these scales in the FJS instead of as ratios. After just a few days, FJS interval names were more intelligible than ratios to him!

When he then started constructing some strange tuning lattices based on factors of 5 and 11, or 7 and 17, or 11, 23, and 47, and showed me pictures of these lattices, I was positively surprised to see all of the note names written in the FJS, seeing that it makes it easier for him to visualize them than just writing bland ratios.

Someone who described his previous microtonal knowledge as “I'm a microtonal music enthusiast, though crawling on all fours” was able to think fluently in the FJS after about a week of knowing about its existence.

That's when I was truly aware that the FJS is, indeed, extremely simple.
