## Can the FJS be used to notate equal temperament tunings?

The short answer is no.

Just Intonation – and consequently, the FJS – relies on the dumb simplicity of manipulating fractions. The level of mathematics required to comprehend Just Intonation theory is no higher than that of junior high school – no logarithms, *n*<sup>th</sup> roots, or – God forbid – integrals are needed (logarithms are only needed when calculating cent values for intervals, which is more of a convenience rather than part of the system). You can carry out most of the calculations in your head, and you can entrust the rest to your trusty four-operation pocket calculator which you'll never again notice has a square root button.

Equal Temperament, on the other hand, is based on equal divisions of the octave (in most cases). Be careful, though, when you generalise, for 1200¢ / 12 = 100¢ might seem too simple at first – cents are merely a representation of the underlying proportions that arise between frequencies, and while some of us might be content with leaving all theory there, the moment you want to convert the seemingly pure cent values into frequency values, you will have to toss all that in an exponential function which returns irrational values for (almost) all rational choices of inputs. Not to mention that the pure, pleasant to the ear (by the definition of ‘ear’) sound of a Just Intonation fifth (3/2) – so significant that all modern harmony was built on it – has an irrational cent value 701.95500086…¢, which ET gets around by approximating more or less crudely. (This is not to say that ET is bad, but that the slightest attempt at introducing it into a JI framework would immediately cause total chaos and hell would break loose.)

This being said, I think that ET doesn't need an FJS to be usable. *n*-EDOs for lower values of *n* can be notated in their entire beauty – without give-and-take – on a regular staff, provided that the pitches, together with accidentals, are well-defined. If *n* is a bit larger, define a couple new accidentals; if *n* goes into the hundreds – or if you want absolute flexibility – you can [borrow](http://musictheory.zentral.zone/huntsystem1.html) from [others](http://sagittal.org/). Or you could make up a new kind of staff and continue from there…

No matter which way you choose, you'll eventually find out that the FJS would have been of zero help to you… Unless you want to approximate the key signature for your upcoming ET piece.

## Why has 3/2 been chosen as the only implied interval and not, for example, 5/4?

I've outlined some of my reasoning on the [comparison](comparison.html) page.

## Why the fuss if I can define my pitches at the top of a score?

Sure, you can do that, but there are a few things you'll be missing on:

- the ability to modulate to any foreign ‘key’ of your choice as you go, without the need for convoluted reassignments or cumbersome or verbose annotations;
- the ‘one size fits all’ property of the FJS which, with very little notational overhead, allows you to use the same system for *all* JI, making way for an intuitive and firm understanding of FJS' – and JI's – inner workings and mental shortcuts;
- quick sightreading – even across scores.

If you care about none of these, FJS might not be the right choice for you. I recommend you to give it a chance anyway.
