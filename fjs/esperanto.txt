1. All notes with conventional accidentals represent Pythagorean tuning. All octaves are 2/1 and all perfect fifths are 3/2.

2. Every prime interval above 3/2 (that is, 5/4, 7/4, 11/8, etc.) is given a unique Pythagorean approximation according to the FJS master algorithm, and the difference between them is assigned a unique accidental for that prime. The number itself is used as the symbol.

3. All FJS accidentals are positive in the direction in which the Pythagorean approximation becomes the target prime interval, and negative otherwise. Positive is not always upward and negative is not always downward; positive is always otonal, while negative is always utonal.

4. Compound accidentals are represented by multiplying the otonal parts and multiplying the utonal parts, so a double +5 is +25. Otonal and utonal are always written separately. If the numbers are too large, the factors may be written out with commas in between.

5. For note names, the positive compound accidental is added as a superscript and the negative compound accidental is added as a subscript to the right of the conventional name.

6. For staff notation, the positive compound accidental is written first (if any), then the negative compound accidental with a minus sign in front (if any), then any conventional accidental, then the note.

7. All else is shorthand.
